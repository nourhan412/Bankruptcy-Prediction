# Bankruptcy-Prediction
This repository contains a data science project completed on 12th March 2023 as an assignment for the Data Science Lab at WorldQuant University. The project focuses on bankruptcy prediction for Polish companies using financial data.

The dataset comprises financial rates and corresponding class labels indicating bankruptcy status for 10503 instances (financial statements) of Polish companies. Among these instances:
- 495 companies represent bankrupted firms.
- 10008 companies did not go bankrupt during the forecasting period.
  
The project included building Decision tree, random forest, and gradient boosting models to predict bankruptcy, Imbalanced Data Handling using resampling techniques such as oversampling and/or undersampling, and Evaluating The performance of each model using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, with a focus on understanding the impact of precision and recall in the imbalanced scenario.
